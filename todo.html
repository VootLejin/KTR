<h1>Philosophy</h1>
<p> Out goal is to get a minimum viable product necessary to play "Kingdom: The Ruling".
There are two major parts that make up the final product known as: 
<a href="#front">"The Front End"</a> and <a href="#back">The Back End"</a>.
The final goal is for a mostly autonomous take on K:tR that allows the players to easily understand and direct their separate kingdoms.
To accomplish this we are planning several features.

<h3>Feature List </h3>

<a id="front"></a><h2> The Front End </h2>
<p> The front end is responisble for what the users/players will see and interact with. 
It will handle accepting turn reports and making the maps visible, as well as providing tools for the players.
</p>
<a id="back"></a><h2> The Back End </h2>
<p> The back end is responisble for automation of world progress, making the GM (Griff)'s life easier.
This will allow for GM intervention in nearly any turn result, but it should not be mandatory.
